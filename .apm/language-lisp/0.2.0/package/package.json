This package is primarily intended for the most popular Lisp dialect â€“ the Common Lisp.\n\nFor proper Lisp indentation and better editing experience this package should be used in conjunction with some advanced editing tool:\n- [Parinfer](https://atom.io/packages/parinfer) (suitable for beginners and gurus alike; automatically manages parentheses based on indentation)\n- [Paredit](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit) (recommended for advanced users; manipulates code as abstract syntax tree)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/enriquefernandez/language-lisp/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/enriquefernandez/language-lisp#readme","_id":"language-lisp@0.2.0","_shasum":"d05bde6ab325390c9adc5ce4802d23b07491c24f","_resolved":"file:../d-116714-15245-pfojs0/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116714-15245-pfojs0/package.tgz"}
